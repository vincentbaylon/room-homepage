## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM
- SASS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This project tested my basic HTML/CSS/JS skills in a good way. It was very challenging but I learned a lot and I feel it greatly improved my grasp on these languages, especially CSS.

### Continued development

I've fallen in love with CSS/SASS/BEM during this project and will continue to push myself with new projects to improve with these languages.

### Useful resources

- [CSS BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) - This helped me learn about BEM methodology.
